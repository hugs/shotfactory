 * If you get '''No browsers registered for factory ...''', please visit 
[https://browsershots.org/browsers/add/ this page] with each of your 
browsers.

== Troubleshooting ==

 * Run '''shotfactory.py -h''' (or '''--help''') to see a list of command 
line options.
 * Run '''shotfactory.py -v''' (or '''--verbose''') to see more output, 
including error messages from helper programs.
 * On Linux, you can run '''xvncviewer :1''' to see the virtual screen of 
the VNC server while a screenshot request is processed.
 * You can also look at the files '''pgdn01.ppm''' or '''browsershot.png''' 
to see if there's a problem.
 * The file '''shotfactory.log''' contains error messages for failed 
screenshot requests.
 * If you use '''screen -L''', the file '''screenlog.0''' will contain the 
full output of the shotfactory script.
 * On Windows, if you run '''shotfactory.exe''' directly with a double 
click, the terminal window may be closed immediately when an error occurs. 
Try to start the terminal first and then run the program from the command 
line to avoid this issue.
